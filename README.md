### ðŸ’» Core Programming & Algorithms

This section is dedicated to the foundational programming skills required for AI development, with an emphasis on creating efficient and well-structured code.

* **Python:** The primary language used for model prototyping, data analysis, and implementing machine learning algorithms.
* **C++:** Utilized to explore performance-critical applications and gain a deeper understanding of the systems that power AI frameworks.
* **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Essential implementations for handling large datasets and designing effective algorithms.

### ðŸ§  Machine Learning

This is the main focus of the repository, covering a range of topics from classic models to modern deep learning architectures. Each area contains practical code examples and project work.

* **Fundamentals of ML:** Implementations of classic algorithms for regression, classification, clustering, and more.
* **Deep Learning:** Building and training neural networks for various tasks.
* **Computer Vision (CV):** Projects focused on image recognition, object detection, and other visual processing tasks.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Code for understanding and generating human language.
* **Generative Models:** Exploring models that can create novel content, from images (GANs, Diffusion) to text.
* **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Training agents to make optimal decisions through interaction with an environment.
* **Speech Processing:** Working with audio data for tasks like recognition and analysis.
